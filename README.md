ASIC design of automatic washing machine

# Introduction

Washing machines are everywhere these days. In this projects we will try to implement ASIC design of Aoutomatic washing machine.

Above given image is the state diagram of Aoutomatic washing machine

In a specific automatic washing machine there are usually six states as given above such as, Check door, Fill water, Add detergent, Cycle, Drain water and Spin.

# About iverilog

Icarus Verilog or iverilog is an implementation of the Verilog hardware description language.

# About GTKWave

GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ v1. 2 based wave viewer for Unix and Win32 which reads Ver Structural Verilog Compiler generated AET files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.

# Downloading iberilog and gtkwave

## For Ubuntu

Open your terminal and write following command.

'''
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install iverilog
$ sudo apt install gtkwave
'''
